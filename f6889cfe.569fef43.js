The idea is that a very large query\ncan be represented in "fragments" that add columns or add rows based on the original "core" query.

Specifically, the motivation for this is that you\ncan have a "core" query that fetches the essential columns for some UI design and then you can add query extension\nfragments that add new/additional columns for some new set of features.  The core and extended columns can be in their\nown fragment and they can be compiled independently.
